# Growth-Models
Maximum Likelihood models of tree growth in the Central Appalachians

Project Lead: Christine Rollinson, crollinson@gmail.com (current affiliation: Boston University)
Collaborators: Margot Kaye (Penn State), Charles Canham (Cary Institute)

These are the scripts to analyze simultaneous influence of size, competition and climate on the growth of trees.  
Scripts were developed with the help of C. Canham, but these versions are currently unpublished (currently undergoing review).
Please contact C. Rollinson for permission to use these scripts or view the data that these scripts are being used to fit.
